mine. Due to the weak weathering in this
area, most of the mineralization occurs in the
original rocks. Two types of mineralization
have been identified, namely, pyrite mineralization of silver, lead and copper mineralization and lead / gold mineralization consisting of lead, gold and a small amount of silver
mineralization in addition to gold mineralization. The mineralization is located in the
quartz vein fault zone and is rich in integrated ore. Ten vein groups have been identified
